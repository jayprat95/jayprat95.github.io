        <title>MindMapper: a investigation into bringing insight to EEG Devices</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-this-project&quot;&gt;About This Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;&quot;&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt; Summary &lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Role&lt;/b&gt; | Researcher, Designer, Developer&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team&lt;/b&gt; | Jayanth Prathipati and &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.cs.vt.edu/rbeaton/&quot;&gt;Bobby Beaton&lt;/a&gt; (Mentor)  &lt;/p&gt; 
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;
          &lt;h3&gt;Problem Space&lt;/h3&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;With the advent of wearables and smart phones, tracking your physical activity has been getting easier. However, tracking your mental focus has not changed. we wanted to explore how we could use EEG devices (think Fitbits but for mental activity instead of physical) and see if we could bring the power of these devices to market. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built an Android app that interfaced with EEG devices to help give actionable feedback to users. Our primary challenge was educating the market on EEG devices and helping users to gain a deeper understanding of how their mental focus trends throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We performed a literature review on quantified-self technologies as well as doing some competitive analysis on what is currently on the market, reading relevant research papers such as such as: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=163348&quot;&gt;AffectAura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.academia.edu/2518447/NeuroPlace_Making_sense_of_a_place&quot;&gt;NeuroPlace&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://infovis.cs.vt.edu/oldsite/papers/CHI02-periphvis.pdf&quot;&gt;An Ordering of Secondary Task Display Attributes&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
    In addition, we intereviewed users with attentional difficulties and tried to get a better understanding of their daily routines. I used this data to create some personas of our target users. 
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;
    We gained some key insights from this research: 
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Users define focus based on the context that they are in. It could mean something different per user and also per activity.  
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Users are focused around increasing productivity
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Users are able to interpret this data well when it is used in conjunction with context such as location and activity
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/competitive_analysis.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;post-caption&quot;&gt;Existing Visualizations in Self-Tracking Apps&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a series of personas and use cases from our initial research. We were specifically interested in how a user would use this product daily and we centered our use cases and personas based on that specific interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;prototyping&quot;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created multiple prototypes in order to evaluate MindMapper. 
I created paper and pencil prototypes and made them interactive using Marvel. I then ran a quick heuristic review with my teammates to better understand if the information visualizations that I created made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly learned that some visualizations were very hard to use. Users used color as an indicator for strength rather than size. We quickly focused on another round of lo-fi prototyping and review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we created a hi-fi sketch prototype that gave target users a better idea of langugage, icons, and notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;evaluation&quot;&gt;Evaluation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our previous results, we quickly found out that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users didn’t understand the meaning of mental focus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design metaphors such as the focus score and the attention score didn’t make sense to users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users felt like the flow of the app didn’t make much sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, I led the development team to make quick 
changes to the app to better fit the mental models for users and create a faster user flow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-this-project&quot;&gt;About This Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;&quot;&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team&lt;/b&gt; | Jayanth Prathipati, &lt;a href=&quot;http://schung7.github.io&quot;&gt;Steven Chung&lt;/a&gt; (Lead Front End Developer &amp;amp; designer), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.cs.vt.edu/rbeaton/&quot;&gt;Bobby Beaton&lt;/a&gt; (Mentor)  &lt;/p&gt; 
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;
          &lt;h3&gt;Problem Space&lt;/h3&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;With the advent of wearables and smart phones, tracking your physical activity has been getting easier. However, tracking your mental focus has not changed. we wanted to explore how we could use the devices that are in our pockets and on our wrists to help us better track what we are doing and see how that could change our behaviors over time.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built an Apple Watch and iPhone app called Jhana that allowed users to self-report their attention. Users get notifications to fill out small 5 second surveys throughout the day on their watch and their phone and get to view graphs and additional insights on their surveys in the corresponding iPhone app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We performed a literature review on quantified-self technologies as well as doing some competitive analysis on what is currently on the market. 
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We also interviewed students who tracking them own activity in various ways such as using Fitbits, Apple Watch, or even manual diary entries like MyFitnessPal and used this data to construct an affinity diagram as well a hierarchical task analysis.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We gained some key insights from this research: 
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Primarily, we found out that user's felt that entering in activity in apps like MyFitnessPal had a lot of mental strain and felt stressed out when filling out this information. 
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      In addition, we found that once users settled into a routine, they didn't find these devices as important anymore as they already knew what insights the Fitbit or MyFitnessPal app would tell them.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/affinity_jh.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;post-caption&quot;&gt;Affinity Diagram from our interviews&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;prototyping&quot;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built low-fi paper prototypes and built a marvel prototype to test our interface. We quickly found that our data entry process was fairly straight forward and didn’t get many complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then moved to a higher fidelity prototype so that we could test some of our interactions on iPhone and Apple Watch. We wanted to make extensive use of swiping on both of these devices since it is a natural and intuitive gesture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to intuitive gestures, We wanted to make use of the hardware features of the Apple Watch, such as the digital crown (knob on the side of the Apple Watch) and make the app feel at home on a user’s home screen rather than a research project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring these ideas to fruition, I designed a swiping leikert scale to make it easier and delightful for users to select how focused they were. Here are examples of this interaction on iPhone and Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//giphy.com/embed/wBHZfKccOgA5q&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;859&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//giphy.com/embed/26FL9ovWI3vCtLU1a&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built out our iPhone app using the interactions we learned from these interactions. We used Core Data to create a local database and made use of a lot of App Kit features such as storyboards and auto-layout to make our app compatible with all screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;evaluation&quot;&gt;Evaluation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran a 2 day user study to study how using a wearable device would change user’s attention. We did pre and post study interviews to understand our users and get their opinions on the product. In addition to that, I integrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.yahoo.com/analytics/&quot;&gt;Flurry Analytics&lt;/a&gt;  into our iPhone and WatchOS app in order to log usage information of the app such as how long users took in order to fill out a survey. We initially thought that users would favor having the combination of an Apple Watch and iPhone and would be able to perform tasks faster. However, we came to some interesting conclusions from our findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We found out that users “felt” that the watch app was much easier to log entries with….however, from our Flurry dashboard we found that the time difference between the watch and the iPhone apps was very small&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We found that users were in fact changing their behavior based after using our app. One user reported to us that she changed her studying habits after getting notifications from the app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We also found that users were not yet acquainted with Apple Watch. Most of our drawbacks came from lack of Apple Watch education. If we performed the study again, we would spend additional time prompting users on how to use the Apple Watch and teach them additional functionality on how to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

          &lt;h3&gt;Problem Space&lt;/h3&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Software professionals are in demand in a lot of places in the world. In addition, they have an opportunity that few others have had before; the ability to work remote. We were curious about what trends were formed in a software developer's job search (being a software developer myself...it seemed like a good thing to look into). In addition, as software developers, we were curious about pay distribution for specific features such as location and programming language of choice. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/&quot;&gt;Beautiful Soup&lt;/a&gt; to parse &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/jobs&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow jobs&lt;/a&gt;, a website with job listings for software developers. We used data about these job listings, such as location, salary, and programming language of choice to see if there would be any clustering. In addition, we were curious about what programming language had the highest starting salaries. Finally, we were curious about how location influenced salary size, we looked into average cost of living and tried to see where developers would get the most in-pocket income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;data-cleaning&quot;&gt;Data Cleaning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We initially had to clean all of the data and try to get the closest major city to a lot of minor locations. For example, we could get a job listing for Queens, New York. We needed to have a way to figure out if that was in the New York metropolitan area. We used reverse geocoding to get the general area of a job and sort our listings by metro locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-results&quot;&gt;Final Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After cleaning our data, we fed this data into NumPy to perform K-Means clustering in order to make better sense of the data. We found (to no surprise)
that jobs were centered around various tech hubs around the US such as S.F, NYC, and Austin. We did find some surprises, namely that Chicago and Atlanta had lots of tech jobs. Chicago had approximately 208 job listings and Atlanta had approximately 63. We have listed two visualizations that we built to better show our results. Please check them below. They are unfortunately not responsive, so please look at them on a laptop or desktop device!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Here is a choropleth map that cumulates all of the developer jobs in the USA. Slide the bar below to see a count of developer jobs for a specific language!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;map&quot; style=&quot;height: 440px; border: 1px solid #AAA;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;value&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Map that shows the different clusters that were generated based on the Jobs data. We overlaid a subsample of the raw Jobs data as markers on this map.&lt;/p&gt;
