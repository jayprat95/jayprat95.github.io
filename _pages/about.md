Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Product Manager at Capital One and I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon's Human Computer Interaction Institute</a>. Before joining CMU, I was a Computer Science student and <a href='http://research.cs.vt.edu/ns/'> UX Researcher at Virginia Tech</a>, a Software Developer at <a href='http://www.element84.com'>Element 84</a>, and an 
<a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/jayanth-prathipati/id1020926584'> indie mobile developer</a>. 
I like wearing many hats and I love to live at the intersection of business, design, and development. After my first year at Virginia Tech, I discovered Human Computer Interaction and Human-Centered Design and have loved its approach in building the best product for your users. 


With my experiences at Capital One, CMU, Element 84, and Virginia Tech, I've learned how to lead interdisciplinary teams of designers and developers and I've helped create some awesome products. I practice a human-centered approach to product development and I would love to bring that approach to your company.
