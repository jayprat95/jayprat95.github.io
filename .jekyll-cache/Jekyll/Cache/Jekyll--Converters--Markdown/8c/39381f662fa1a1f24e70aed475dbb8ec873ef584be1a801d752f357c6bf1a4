I"a<p>Hi! 👋 I’m a Product Manager at Capital One and I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon’s Human Computer Interaction Institute</a>. Before joining CMU, I was a Computer Science student and <a href="http://research.cs.vt.edu/ns/"> UX Researcher at Virginia Tech</a>, a Software Developer at <a href="http://www.element84.com">Element 84</a>, and an 
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/jayanth-prathipati/id1020926584"> indie mobile developer</a>. 
I like wearing many hats and I love to live at the intersection of business, design, and development. After my first year at Virginia Tech, I discovered Human Computer Interaction and Human-Centered Design and have loved its approach in building the best product for your users.</p>

<p>With my experiences at Capital One, CMU, Element 84, and Virginia Tech, I’ve learned how to lead interdisciplinary teams of designers and developers and I’ve helped create some awesome products. I practice a human-centered approach to product development and I would love to bring that approach to your company.</p>
