          <p id="about-description">
            I like wearing many hats and I love to live at the intersection of business, design, and development. After my first year at Virginia Tech, I discovered Human Computer Interaction and Human-Centered Design and have loved its approach in building the best product for your users. I've learned how to lead interdisciplinary teams of designers and developers and I've helped create some awesome products. I'd love to bring my approach to your company.</p>
